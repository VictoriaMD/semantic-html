                <h3>Characteristics</h3>
                <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.
                    It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
                     A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact.
                     Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents.</p>

            <aside>
                <p>As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the United States by number of pets owned, after freshwater fish, with 95 million cats owned.
                    In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019.</p>

                <h3>Behaviour</h3>
                <p>Most cats are playful animals and enjoy socialising with people. 
                    Cats like to play with toys and those that do not go outside often play at hunting indoors. 
                    Some cats, especially those that live outdoors, may be less sociable with people and other animals.</p>
                
                <p>Cats sleep for many hours each day. When they are awake they need opportunities to exercise and play. 
                    Additionally, all cats need a suitable scratching place, high enough to allow them to stretch out fully, 
                    to mark their territory and condition their claws.</p>

                <h3>Interaction with humans</h3>
                <p>Cats between the age of three and nine weeks are sensitive to human socialization.
                     After this period, socialization can be less effective.
                     Studies have shown that the earlier the kitten is handled, the less fearful the kitten will be towards humans.
                     Other factors that can enhance socialization are having many people handle the kitten frequently, 
                     the presence of the mother, and feeding.
                     The presence of the mother is important because cats are observational learners. 
                     A mother that is comfortable around humans can reduce anxiety in the kitten and promote the kitten-human relationship.</p>
